# Dotfiles for my Ubuntu setup

A collection of my dotfiles (mostly minor tweaks to default configs) along with a simple setup script for Ubuntu.

Beware that the setup script is destructive. Any config files that get in the way are lost.

To implement simple firewall rules, install programs and put symlinks to dotfiles in place, simply run `./setup.sh`.
