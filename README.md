# Dotfiles for my Ubuntu setup

A collection of my dotfiles (mostly minor tweaks to default configs) along with a setup script for my Ubuntu setup.

Beware that the setup script is destructive. Any config files that get in the way are lost.

To install programs and put symlinks to config files in place, run `./setup.sh`.
